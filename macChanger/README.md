THIS IS A SIMPLE MAC ADDRESS CHANGER 

HOW TO USE: 

1.) The app will ask you what interface you would like to change. Either write "eth0", "eth1", or "wlan0" if you have them.
2.) After that the app will then ask you to input the custom MAC ADDRESS that you would like to use. Example "00:00:00:00:00:00".
